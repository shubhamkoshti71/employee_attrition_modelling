# Attrition Prediction and Strategy for Telecommunications Company

## Problem Statement
A large Telecommunications company with approximately 4000 employees experiences a significant turnover rate, with about 15% of employees leaving annually. This high attrition rate poses several challenges:
- **Project Delays**: Leading to a loss of reputation among consumers and partners.
- **Resource Intensity**: Requires substantial resources to maintain a large recruitment department.
- **Reduced Productivity**: The onboarding period for new staff diminishes work effectiveness.

To address these issues, a workplace engineering & analytics firm was hired to identify the underlying factors of high attrition and recommend workplace adjustments to enhance retention. 
The key task was to determine which variables are most critical and need immediate attention.

## Goal
As a leading data scientist on the team, the project's objectives were:
- Model the probability of attrition.
- Present findings and strategic recommendations to the senior management to help reduce the current attrition rate.
- Suggest improvements to enhance the efficiency of data collection and analysis processes.

## Methods and Models Used
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: Prepared data through comprehensive cleaning and feature engineering.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilized Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, achieving accuracies of 78% and 96% respectively, to predict employee attrition.

## Key Findings
- **Total Working Hours**: Longer hours are positively correlated with attrition.
- **Job and Environment Satisfaction**: Low satisfaction significantly contributes to higher attrition rates.
- **Years at Company**: Longer tenure correlates with reduced attrition, indicating stability decreases turnover.

## Strategic Recommendations
- **Work Schedule Flexibility**: Implement flexible scheduling to alleviate the strain from long working hours.
- **Enhanced Job Satisfaction**: Improve workplace conditions and job satisfaction to retain employees.
- **Recognition Programs**: Develop programs to acknowledge employee achievements, particularly targeting young professionals.

## Data Collection and Analysis Improvements
- **Automation**: Automate data preprocessing to ensure consistency and efficiency.
- **Qualitative Feedback**: Integrate qualitative assessments into performance reviews to gain deeper insights.
- **Focus on Impactful Variables**: Streamline data collection to focus on variables with significant impacts on attrition predictions.

## Conclusion
The recommendations provided aim to significantly reduce the attrition rate by addressing identified key drivers and optimizing existing processes. The implementation of these strategies is expected to enhance overall employee satisfaction and operational efficiency.
